# GeoGame
We created a 2-player game in Unity where player 1 creates a challenge polygon for player 2 to illuminate with as few lights as possible. Scores for each round are awarded to the player that places the lights, using a simple equation "points = vertices / lights", motivating the user that draws the polygon to create a difficult challenge with as few vertices as possible. After each round, the roles are swapped. When a player reaches 10 points, the game ends. The players are also allowed to set a different target score.
